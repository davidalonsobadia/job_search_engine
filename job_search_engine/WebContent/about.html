					<h4>Working in English</h4>
					<p>Working in English is a personal project which I developed to learn more about Servlet/JSP and Java programming in General.</p>
					
					<p>The whole web appliction was made from scratch, which no help of frameworks.</p>
					
	            	<p>It uses several APIs to get all job data from different sources. It doesn't store any data. Just show search results.</p>
	
	            	<p>The purpose of the whole project was only academic.</p>
